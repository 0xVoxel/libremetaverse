LibreMetaverse
===============================================================================
LibreMetaverse is a fork of libOpenMetaverse which in turn was a fork of
libSecondLife, a library for developing Second Life-compatible virtual world
clients. LibreMetaverse returns the focus to up-to-date Second Life and OpenSim
compatibility with an eye to performance, multi-threading, and memory management.

The canonical source for LibreMetaverse can be found at:

## Simple installation procedure

(Linux/macOS only)

- Make sure you have at least `dotnet` installed, with a valid net5.0/net6.0 SDK _and_ runtime available!
- From the root, run `dotnet restore`. You should get some errors regarding missing Windows libraries; that's ok, you can ignore those, they're to be expected since Linux/macOS do _not_ include such libraries. Some test applications are Windows-only.  
If all goes well, you should now have all dependent packages properly installed.
- From the root, run `dotnet msbuild`, and enjoy the superfast Roslyn compiler at work ðŸ˜„ It should finish after a few minutes, depending on the speed of your machine.
- Your binaries will be under `../bin/net5.0` or `../bin/net6.0` (there might be a few more directories under `../bin`), depending on what runtimes you have installed on your system. Make sure you `cd` to the correct directory depending on the runtime you have, and then search for all your binaries there: they should be normal-looking executable files (with the `x` attribute set) and having the name of the appropriate test application (e.g. `TestClient` for the interactive testing tool).
- Unlike OpenSimulator, you don't need to launch the binaries with Mono, they're _directly_ executable; the `dotnet` chain already embeds the small runtime that allows .NET apps to run natively on whatever operating system you've got.
